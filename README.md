## Abstract
This final project represents a culmination of all of the topics covered during MICRO-452. The goal was to place a Thymio robot within an obstacle field, and use computer vision, path planning, global navigation, and local navigation to direct it to a goal. The first step of the process was to decide on the environment the Thymio would be placed within. We considered the examples provided from previous semesters, and eventually we decided on a simple white background with 3D colored blocks as obstacles.</br> The intention was to have enough contrast between the obstacles and the background to allow an accurate contour detection. </br>The goal and the Thymio were both identified using ArUco marker detection. This allowed for an accurate tracking of both the position and orientation of the Thymio, which were integral in applying a global navigation framework based on computer vision. We were able in this project to successfully perfom the global navigation **with and without** camera using the filtering, **avoid** the **obstacles** locally using sensor data and to do a **kidnapping** test.

## Organization within the team
Each member of the team had expressed his area of interest. We had each member concentrating on a specific area as well as having an overview over the other remaining methods. We end up each doing a part and contributing in the other parts.

## Setting up the project 

### Project Dependencies
Activate virtualenv in root directory 
```bat
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Install the necessary Dependencies by running
```bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The requirement list will be updated and added along the project to make a reproducible code
